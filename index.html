        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <img src="assets/images/me.jpg">
        <p>My name is Enrique Rosales, but usually people call me Ricky. I am 22 years old and I'm currently in a certificate
            program at Northwestern Univeristy.</p>
        <br>
        <p>A little backstory on me, I was born in Naperville, Illinois and grew up in a small townhouse in Aurora. I lived
            there until 3rd grade until I moved to Oak Park, Illinois where I finished elementary and most of middle school.
            I left Oak Park in 8th grade and moved to Yorkville, Illinois where I finsihed up middle school and went to high
            school until Sophomore year. Sophomore year I left Yorkville and moved to Warrenville, Illinois and finished
            my high school.
            <p>
                <br>
                <p>From high school I moved around for a bit until I moved to Park Ridge and decided to work in a butcher shop
                    to maybe to decide to become a butcher. I worked there for a couple of years until I decided it wasn't
                    for me. Working with computers have always been pretty easy for me (my Dad works with computers so I
                    was exposed to them through him) so I saw an opportunity with this program and here I am today!</p>
